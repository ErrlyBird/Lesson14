            <br></br>
            <p>I became fascinated with web development at a young age. I took a class where
			all the students created a simple web page from scratch using raw HTML and 
			the notepad application. Since then I have always had an interest in the web development
			field. The way things are done and utilized are much different than in the past.
			But that is just one more thing I love about this industry. I enjoy design the most,
			but there are no aspects of the web development business that find
			insubstantial. I enjoy learning and growing and hope to become a well rounded
			developer in my future.
